Analysis:

We obtain two data set:
First data set include Mouse_Metada Data consist of ID,Se, Age,Weight, and Drug information.Second data set consists of treatment information for the each mice with size of tumor, medication, timepoints, and progress(regress) of tumor.
We started our analysis combining two data sets together to determine any relationship between variables in the data.
-The data has no biases in the sex of the mice. Female and male mice population is close to each other with male population 1.92% higher. The variance in insignificant.
-The sttistical analysis of each drug regimen demonstrated similar distrubition. based standard deviation we can conclude that the data clustered around mean and median. Other than Infubinol drug regimen tehre is no outliers in the data.
-Total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen show also similar pattern.
-when the relationship between # of times mice tested and Tumor volume tested, it conluded that the relationship is linear and negatively correlated. it indicates that at the first test timepoint the tumor volume/mass is high, but tumor reduces volume as medication is applied and the tests are repeated. This concludes that all the other variables being constant, for Drug Regimen Capomulin Treatment is showing progress for mouse "s185".
-The relationship between mice weight and tumor volume variables also show linear relationship. Contrary to timepoint, the relationship is positively correlated. When tumor volume increases the mouse weight  also increases.
